NRDC Data Preparation and Analysis Using Tensorflow

Project designed using Python scripts and Tensorflow.

Next step: Make dataextraction.py interpret. Test data can be found under tensorflow_datasets/manual

Project Description: Make a sensor dataset for Tensorflow and perform simple analysis. Extract data from http://sensor.nevada.edu/SENSORDataSearch/, where several different sensor data is available and you can choose one or more datasets. Then use Tensorflowâ€™s API to create a dataset that is ready for Tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/add_dataset. Please make sure you clean the data first. Please also make some simple analysis for the data as well: e.g., compute the mean, standard deviation, ADD, MAD, and distribution. Please also use visualization to demonstrate the data and your analysis results. Note: wind speed prediction is NOT allowed as it has been used in Data Mining class.
